
In C#, a delegate is a powerful construct that acts as a reference type variable. Here's a breakdown of what delegates are and how they're used:

What are delegates?

Delegates are a type that represents references to methods with a particular set of parameters and a return type.
Think of them like a contract that specifies the method signature (parameters and return type) but doesn't contain the implementation itself.
You can assign any method that matches the delegate's signature to a delegate instance.
Why use delegates?

Delegates are primarily used for the following purposes:
Event handling: They are the foundation for event handling in C#. Events allow objects to communicate asynchronously by notifying interested parties (subscribers) when a specific event occurs. Delegates define the method signature for event handlers.

Callback methods: You can pass methods as arguments to other methods using delegates. This enables a more flexible and dynamic approach to programming.

LINQ queries: Delegates are used extensively in LINQ (Language Integrated Query) expressions to define filtering, sorting, and other operations on sequences of data.



Feature 	    Array	                                    ArrayList
Size	        Fixed	                                    Dynamically resizable
Data Type	    Strongly typed (single data type)	        Non-generic (stores elements of type object)
Performance	    Generally better	                     Lower due to dynamic natureandpotential boxing/unboxing
Functionality	Basic (accessing elements, iterating)	    Richer set of methods for collection manipulation
Use Cases	    Known size, same data type, performance	    Dynamic size, mixed data types



Lambda expressions in C# are used like anonymous functions, with the difference that in Lambda expressions you don’t need to specify the type of the value that you input thus making it more flexible to use. 
The ‘=>’ is the lambda operator which is used in all lambda expressions.
